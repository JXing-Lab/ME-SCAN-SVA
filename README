# Purpose : Identification and analysis of MEI using ME-Scan data using BWA-BLAST pipeline.

# Requireements: BWA, Blast, LiftOver, Samtools, Bedtools, Primer3

# prepation_0:
1. target directory includes subdirectories (named as "Sample_...") containing Fastq files (pair_end)
2. file with .parameters extension should be located at target directory

# Folders
example_family_list >> the folder contains an example named as "family_list.ped" << Format: Family_ID   Individual_ID     Father  Mother  Sex >>
example_parameters >> the folder contains examples of .parameter files

# .parameters include ..
<parameter>
        MEI
        MEI_ref_RM  #==> when we make reference MEI dataset, alow this terms based on the interection with RepeatMasker
        MEI_known_stewart #==> this term is for extracting pMEI dataset from previous study, stewart et al. 2011
        MEI_known_dbrip #==> this term is used for file name of pMEI dataset from previous study, dbRIP / for extracting, MEI was used.
        MEI_known_1kproject
        window_size  #==> The range from mapping site
        mapq_bwa  #==> bwa mapping quality
        blast_score_R1 #==> Blast bit score
        blast_score_ref #==> Blast bit score
        primer_position #==> if the ME specific primer is located on head part (5'), input 5
        ME_fragment  #==>this will be used for blast. xxx when file name is xxx_primer.fasta, it can include additional infor mation) # Caution: direction primer binding site to end of ME
        ME_specific_first_primer #==> 'on' will be choosed for removing read2s which are 100% covered. If you choose 'off', the option is not available
        ME_specific_seminested_primer #==> 'fixed' or 'flexible' clustering method can be choosed
        repeatcover
        clustering_type

        # ==> MEI_ref_RM, MEI_known_stewart, MEI_known_dbrip can allow multiple terms using regular expression e.g. MEI_ref_RM=AluYb8\|AluYb9

        path_mescan #==> the location of ME-Scan tools

# preparation_1
Download whole codes.
# preparation_2
Download and modify reference file based on their own README in each "ref_"* subdirectories.
# preparation_3
Make pathfile named as "ME-Scan.path" and parameterfile with ".parameters" extension in the working directory. There are methods how to make 
# Executable file: ME-SCAN-SVA.sh 
the user should use "source" command "source /"software_path"/ME-SCAN-SVA.sh" in the working directory.
