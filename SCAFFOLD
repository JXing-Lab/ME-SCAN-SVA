PRE. reference MEI dataset using BLAST against human genome, hg19 (you can skip if you've already made it)

A. Pick up BLAST bit-score cutoffed reference MEI dataset

B. BWA-Blast mapping & identification (1-5)

	1. Mapped by BWA and filtered by Blast
	2. preparations for identification of insertion sites 
	3. Report the number of filtered reads
	4. Clustering the insertion sites
	5. Choose estimated points (reading end of representative reads) with depth and the number of read variants 

C. Extract and liftover MEI from published dataset (dbRIP, Stewart et al. 2011, 1000 genome structural variant)

D. Analysis & generate figures(1-13)

	1. Caculate sensitivity"
	1a. Report TPM cutff at 90, 95% sensitivity "
	2. Draw sensitivity plot"
	3. Candidates for genotyping (required step 2)"
	4. Draw number of loci by TPM cutoff"
	5. Draw boxplot of number of loci by TPM cutoff(required step 3)"
	6. Draw number of new loci by TPM cutoff per unrelated individuals" 
	7. Draw boxplot of number of new loci by TPM cutoff per unrelated individuals (required step 5)"
	8. Draw accumulative  number of new loci  from unrelated individuals at chosen TPM cutoff (required step 5)"
	9. Draw pie chart for showing intersection with functional regions"
	10. Draw heatmap of intersection with ENCODE regulatory region (ChromHMM)"
	11. Make table for identifying de novo insertion and Draw histogram of unique mapping reads from de novo insertion"
	12. Draw the number of de novo loci by TPM cutoff"

E. Primer design for genotyping
F. Cleanup
