inheritance_calculation.py is used to generate:    (input: strigent_and_TPMcutoff_SVA.txt)
-- out_inheritance.txt ------------------ the number of insertion before and after TPM for each trio
-- kid_inheritance_aftTPM.txt/kid_inheritance_befTPM.txt --------------- list of insertion bef/aft TPM that is found in each parent and none
--------------in folder output_from_stringent_inheritance

bed2vcf.py is used to convert bed file (need to have TPM, unique read calculated) to vcf file ---- the output of vcf file is the same location as the bed file, input: one file, or two files with plus and minus separated
----- need to add the code of removing ME from the file name if were to use for all ME

candidate_loci_flexible_window.py is used to generate:
sorted_All_inds_flexible_500/1000bp_minus/plus_insert_loci.txt -------------- to make sure that my output will be the same as Ha's output
----------- in folder windowSize_candidate

1XTPM_inheritance_calculation.py is used to generate:
--polymorphic_insertion_kid_inheritance.txt       	    							|
--novel_polymorphic_insertion_kid_inheritance.txt								|
-------------using files generated by Ha (after TPM cutoff of 4.2 for all inds)

template_inheritance_calculation.py is used to generate:			
--polymorphic_insertion_48.48_variableTPM_and_UR_kid_inheritance.txt						|
--novel_polymorphic_insertion_48.48_variableTPM_and_UR_kid_inheritance.txt					|
--48.48_count_loci_group_poly_and_novel_poly.png								|
--More_than_5UR_0.5TPM_Novel_polymorphic_insertion_minus/plus.SVA.29.48.48.500.repeatcover_off.flexible.BB.bed	|-------- in folder "output_from_inheritance_mild". The same files were
--48.48_Novel_polymorphic_inheritance_calculation_error_rate.txt						|	  generated in folder "output_from_inheritance_stringent"
--48.48_Polymorphic_inheritance_calculation_error_rate.txt							|
------------- with TPM 0.5X,1X and 2X and unique read > 0,1,2...,21

fixed_template_inheritace_calculation.py is used to generate:
--Fixed_insertion_48.48_variableTPM_and_UR_kid_inheritance.txt                                                  |

producing_fixed_insertion_with_ind_info.py is used to generate:
--generating_list_of_fixed_insertion/mild/Fixed_insertion_minus/plus.SVA.29.48.48.500.repeatcover_off.flexible.BB.bed (The same for stringent)----- same format like Ha's bed file to be used as the input for template_inheritance_calculation.py

tabulating_UR_for_more_than_5.py is used to generate:
-- category_More_than_5UR_0.5TPM_Novel_polymorphic_insertion_minus/plus.txt					|

sensitivity_surface_TPM_UR.py is used to generate:
--average/overall/NA1*_sensitivity_analysis_with_variableTPM_and_UR.txt		-----------in folder "output_from_inheritance_mild/sensitivity". The same files were generated in folder "output_from_inheritance_stringent/sensitivity"

heatmap.py is used to generate:
--heatmap_sensitivity_analysis_48.48.png									|
--TPM_stats_90_maxUR_5/10_48.48.txt	---- Result: No significant difference between 5 and 10 UR,		|
						     especially in term of TPM. Only 3/4 individuals have minor change. So, we decided to go with maxUR = 10

latest_data_with_TPM_UR_as_filter.py is used to generate:
--latest_data_TPM-5/10UR_filters_Polymorphic/Novel_polymorphic_insertion_minus/plus_48.48.bed ------------------------------|
															    |-in folder "output_from_inheritance_mild/latest_data_with_TPM_UR_filters
template_inheritance_calculation_for_latest_data_with_TPM-UR_filters.py is used to generate (only inheritance error rate):  | ". The same files were generated in folder "output_from_inheritance_st
--latest_data_TPM-5/10UR_filters_48.48_Polymorphic/Novel_polymorphic_inheritance_calculation_error_rate.txt ----------------|  ringent/latest_data_with_TPM_UR_filters"
														** I put all the latest_data_TPM-5UR_filters_* in "supplementary_5UR" folder

1st_candidate.py is used to generate:
--latest_data_with_TPM_UR_filters/latest_data_TPM-10UR_filters_1st_candidate_minus/plus_48.48.bed		|


ME-Scan_tools folder is replicated from /usr/local and adding step_10.sh and step_11.sh --- to generate annotation and ChromHMM results
-- latest_data_with_TPM_UR_filters/annotation folder contains output from step_10.sh				|
-- latest_data_with_TPM_UR_filters/ChromHMM folder contains output from step_11.sh				|
